## For Dieter

- not getting most recent data for some packages (e.g. dplyr)
- how does relative links api work
- packages endpoint returns `latest_version_id` -> how to use this?
- need updated favicon
- monthly downloads for past 12 months -> API
- images with relative paths don't work (e.g. dplyr)
