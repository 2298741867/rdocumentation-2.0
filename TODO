## Today

- fetch github data (issues, stars, PRs, forks)
- add canonical link to copy on each page
- add bug report link on package page?
- add contributor data on package page
- send API requirements to dieter

## Later

- make everything responsive (mobile first?)
- add custom 404 (with dark mode)
    - https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page#404-page
- make some topic links relative
- add search in nav on package / topic pages
- don't use my personal github auth token
- get search setup (wait for dieter)
- replace recharts with something better maintained (see console warnings)
- make the trends page official

## Helpful links

- https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8
- https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/mutate

- https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.13.4
- https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.13.4/topics/fread

## For Dieter

- not getting most recent data for some packages (e.g. dplyr)
- how does relative links api work
- packages endpoint returns `latest_version_id` -> how to use this?
