- link to vignettes (included in package endpoint)
- update readme with helpful info
- add search in nav on package / topic pages
- don't use my personal github auth token
- get search setup (wait for dieter)
- strip badges directly from the markdown?
- deal with monthly downloads chart for new packages
- show different install instructions for bioc packages
- add syntax highlighting for R code (see branch)

## For Dieter

- not getting most recent data for some packages (e.g. dplyr)
- packages endpoint returns `latest_version_id` -> how to use this?
- need updated favicon
- monthly downloads for past 12 months -> API
- images with relative paths don't work (e.g. dplyr)
- how to get total package count for home page?
- only show search results for latest package versions?
- version agnostic topic lookup? (e.g. mutate in dplyr version X)
