## For Dieter

- don't use my personal github auth token
- not getting most recent data for some packages (e.g. dplyr)
- packages endpoint returns `latest_version_id` -> how to use this?
- need updated favicon
- monthly downloads for past 12 months -> API
- images with relative paths don't work (e.g. dplyr)
- how to get total package count for home page?
- only show search results for latest package versions?
- version agnostic topic lookup? (e.g. mutate in dplyr version X)
- need a sitemap?
- update on search?
- deadline end of january
